DO NOT RESIZE ANY TILESET(.TSX) IT WILL CAUSE AN ENTIRE PROJECT LOSS!!! (YOU CAN CHANGE ONLY THE NUMBER OF ROWS)

SAVE BACKUPs AS .PNG FILES WITHOUT ZOOM (THIS WILL GIVE YOU THE POSSIBILITY TO REMAKE YOUR .TSX FILES)

YOU CAN EDIT YOUR IMAGES (.PNG):
1) YOU CAN RESIZE THE HEIGHT, BUT NEVER THE WIDTH!
2) YOU CAN EDIT A SINGLE TILE (FOR EXAMPLE A ROCK), BUT BE AWARE THAT ALL YOUR PROJECTS THAT USED THAT 'ROCK TILE' WILL BE AFFECTED.
